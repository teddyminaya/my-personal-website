    <h3>About Me!</h3>
    <p> I've been working for Apple for three years and finally decided to take a step toward my dream of being a Software Developer. Before working for Apple, I worked as a Front Desk Agent for the biggest hotel in Times Square, The New York Mariott Marquis. I hope to one day work for a professional sports organzation as a software developer. In regards to my personal life, I've been living
        in New Jersey my whole life and graduated from the University of Tampa in 2016 with a degree in psychology.
